## **Case Study: Urban Population Distribution in Indian Cities**

### **Objective**

This case study aims to analyze the distribution of population across major Indian cities, focusing on administrative roles (admin, minor, and primary capitals), urban density, and spatial spread, using data from a population dashboard and geographical coordinates.

---

This study utilizes one datasets:

* **India Cities LatLng.csv**: Contains geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) of Indian cities.

---

### **Methodology**

* **Population metrics** were examined across two categories:

  * **Population Proper**: Refers to the core municipal areas.
  * **Total Population**: Includes metro and suburban extensions.
* Cities were classified into three capital types:

  * **Admin** (state capitals),
  * **Minor** (district-level),
  * **Primary** (likely national capital or administrative zone).
* **Geospatial analysis** was conducted using city coordinates to visualize and assess geographic spread.

---

### **Key Findings**

1. **High Concentration in Admin Capitals**:

   * **Admin capitals** hold approximately **93% of the total population** across the cities analyzed.
   * These include mega-cities like **Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Bangalore**, and **Chennai**.

2. **Megacities Dominate**:

   * **Delhi** and **Mumbai** collectively account for over **20%** of the total urban population.
   * **Delhi** alone has a total population nearing **30 million**, the highest among all.

3. **Disparity Between Core and Metro Areas**:

   * Significant differences were observed between "population proper" and "total population", particularly in metro cities.
   * Indicates urban sprawl and growth beyond municipal boundaries.

4. **Low Population in Primary Capital**:

   * The **primary capital**, possibly referring to **New Delhi** as a small administrative region, shows a surprisingly low figure (\~142k in population proper).

5. **Geographical Spread**:

   * The cities are widely spread across the country, with latitudinal and longitudinal totals indicating broad national coverage.

---

### **Suggestions**

* **Policy Focus**: Urban planning efforts must prioritize rapidly growing metro areas, especially admin capitals.
* **Infrastructure Pressure**: Major cities are under pressure from high population density, calling for expanded transportation, housing, and utilities.
* **Smart City Development**: Growth outside city cores emphasizes the need for integrated urban-rural development plans.
* **Data-Driven Governance**: Utilizing detailed spatial and demographic data can improve decision-making at state and district levels.

### **Conclusion**

This case study highlights the need for strategic urban planning based on robust population and location data. By identifying patterns in capital city population distributions, stakeholders can better allocate resources, plan infrastructure, and design policies for sustainable urban growth in India.
